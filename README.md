# Eris
Eris is a Discord bot framework built on top of discord.py. Sacrificing a bit of direct control for a lot of nice
convenience functionality such as using hooks for events and a modular class-based approach to handling events.

## Installation
This project requires discord.py for the basic functionality and jsonschema to verify that the configuration file is
correctly formatted before it tries to start with it.

It can be installed using `python setup.py install` or using pip and pointing it at this GitHub repository.

## Documentation
TODO.
